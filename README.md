# LFGsniper
A discord bot to help you find a suitable LFG

## Disclaimer:

If someone else knows your token, they can hack into your account and will have full access to all of your Discord account information.
Using this on a user account is prohibited by the Discord TOS and can lead to the account block.
I don't take any responsibility for blocked Discord accounts that used this app.
Changing the react delay to a low number can be very obvious and suspicious.
Careless use may lead to you getting reported and banned from the discord servers you use this on.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
